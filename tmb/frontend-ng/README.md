# Backend-for-Frontend: Frontend

1. In your filesystem, open a console in the `auth-architecture-ng/bff/frontend` folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to run the development environment, accessible in the browser at `http://localhost:4200`

If you have the backend and FusionAuth both running, you should be able to log into the frontend app with the admin credentials provided in the FusionAuth installation section.
